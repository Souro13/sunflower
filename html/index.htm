  <p><em>Things will go tough and get even harder as time advances. Life will be riddled with lies, you'll feel just to sit at home all day long. But remember,<strong>That you're strong.Stronger than the problems you face.</strong>The wheel always rotates. Good times will come as surely as the bad times does. you'll have to be patient, and I trust you with this. Remember your reasons, your goals, and the people who stood by you when time was hard. And it'sgonna be fine, my sunflower!! Don't let anyone else shadow your brightness!❤️</em></p>
